                    <h4>What is the idea?</h4>

                    <p>
                    You are walking into a small coffee shop. Credit cards are not accepted here,
                    because of high processing fees, but this shop did make the one-time purchase of
                    a piece of commodity hardware - a small box which sits next to the cash
                    register.  “I’d like to pay with Bitcoin please”, you say and after another
                    button press on the cash register the box comes to life. You tap your phone on
                    it, confirm the payment details in your favorite wallet and moments later the
                    merchant sees your payment. You are done and enjoy your coffee!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Not everything in this vision will be part of this project, but I hope I can get
                    your support to finish the first step: Build that small box - the “Bitcoin Box”!
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why is it needed?</h4>

                    <p>
                    Most Bitcoin point of sale solutions are software-only, usually targeting
                    Android devices. This makes sense in many situations, as Android phones are
                    cheap and ubiquitous. But having to support a mix of devices, makes it hard
                    to really optimize the process. In many cases the state of the art still is
                    displaying QR codes of Bitcoin addresses and listening for unreliable broadcasts
                    on the Bitcoin network. NFC especially is a weak point, as low-end devices
                    either do not have it or the antenna is inconveniently located for a checkout
                    situation. All this often ultimately results in the impression that Bitcoin is a
                    clunky way to pay in person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I feel it would therefore be beneficial to have a "reference system" of sorts,
                    which implements all best practices, all the latest standards and invents them
                    where they are still missing. The aim is to showcase how fast, reliable and
                    convenient a Bitcoin payment can be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    On top of that, one additional important advantage of the Raspberry Pi is that
                    it has an Ethernet port, which will make it possible to connect it to cash
                    registers. This kind of integration will not be part of this crowdfunding round,
                    but it would be the next logical step.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What is the Bitcoin Box?</h4>

                    <p>
                    The video above shows the current state of the Bitcoin Box. It is a standalone
                    Bitcoin point of sale terminal, which is build around NFC to provide contactless
                    payments and also displays QR codes alongside. It increases reliability of
                    in-person payments, by allowing wallets to send payment via Bluetooth. As a
                    result, wallets can even be completely offline and still be able to complete a
                    transaction. The box makes use of BitPay's service to provide merchants with
                    payout in various currencies, including bitcoin.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Who is doing the work?</h4>

                    <p>
                    My name is <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/pub/jan-vornberger/75/a90/29b">Jan Vornberger</a>,
                    I have been interested in Bitcoin point of sale solutions since 2011, when I released one of
                    the <a href="https://github.com/javgh/greenaddress-pos-tools">first prototypes</a> in that
                    area as open source. I was the founder of Instawallet and
                    <a href="https://www.bridgewalkerapp.com/">Bridgewalker</a>
                    (precursor to Bitreserve/Coinlock), coined the term 'green address' and do
                    Android development for <a href="https://hivewallet.com/">Hive</a>. I believe
                    that I bring the necessary skills and connections within the
                    Bitcoin community to the table, to successfully complete this
                    project.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What will the funds be used for?</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Finishing the software</strong> that makes the Bitcoin Box tick, getting it to
                        a production ready state in terms of reliability and robustness and
                        releasing it under an open source license.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Instructions</strong>, including a list of components, on how to build a Bitcoin Box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Standardization work</strong>: Coordinating with the Bitcoin developer
                        community to agree on and document the technical standards used by the
                        Bitcoin box. TBIP74 and TBIP75 are two proposals that are already
                        underway in this area (see
                        <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07144.html">this thread</a>
                        for the current state of the discussion).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p></p>

                    <h4>What is Lighthouse?</h4>

                    <p>
                    Lighthouse is a new approach to all-or-nothing fundraising directly on the
                    blockchain. Using advanced features of the Bitcoin protocol, it is now possible
                    to create Kickstarter-style fundraising initiatives without the need for a
                    middleman. Instead, the Lighthouse software allows you to create special Bitcoin
                    transactions that are only valid if enough other people also contribute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In that way, you remain in full control over your funds, up until the moment the
                    project is fully funded. Before that point is reached, pledges can be undone at
                    any time without the involvement of the project creator.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How to pledge using Lighthouse?</h4>

                    <p>
                    Unlike other crowdfunding platforms, Lighthouse is not a company, website or
                    service. It is an open source desktop app you can download and run. You are
                    always in control of your own money and fundraisers.
                    </p>

                    <p>Follow these steps to pledge via Lighthouse:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        <a href="https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse">Download the Lighthouse app</a>
                        and run it on your computer. It might ask you to restart at least once, and
                        you'll need to wait until the "Synchronizing" progress bar disappears.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Download the <a href="#todo">Bitcoin Box Lighthouse project file</a> and
                        double-click it or drag it into the Lighthouse window or onto the Lighthouse
                        icon. You should then see the project displayed inside Lighthouse.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        To make a pledge, you need to transfer the funds to Lighthouse's internal
                        wallet first. Send the amount you want to contribute to the address you see in
                        the top-left corner of the window - click one of the icons next to it to copy
                        the address or show a QR code. The minimum pledge amount is 10 mBTC / 3 USD.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Wait for the bitcoins to arrive in the Lighthouse wallet - this shouldn't
                        usually take more than a few seconds. Then, with the Bitcoin Box project
                        selected, click the "Pledge" button on the right.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Click "Maximum amount possible", or enter an amount manually. If you want to
                        be listed as a crowdfunding backer on the website, enter a name (note: this will
                        be visible for everyone on the project page) or an email address (will not
                        be displayed). You can also enter an optional message (also public). When you're
                        ready, click "Confirm".
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                    I hope that with your help this project can be realized! Lighthouse fundraising
                    does not have an end date by default, but I would like to let the campaign run
                    only until April 10, 2015 to have a clear cut-off date. It would be great if you
                    could maintain your pledge until then. Thank you for your contribution!
                    </p>
